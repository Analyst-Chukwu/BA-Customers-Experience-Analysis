Anyway I checked in online eventually and made my way through security. I asked an information post - as to where the Club / Business class lounge was and I was told it was land side and between \"this terminal and the next terminal\". I could not believe it. Surely a simple prompt online when checking in - could have told me this. Flight left on time a reasonable light lunch and three Gin and Tonics later we got stacked over the East End for 25 minutes but landed \"ahead of schedule\".
